Hello! Welcome to my personal website. You can find two types of posts in here. I may write about my thoughts, either formal with maths/code or informal trains of thoughts, in 'articles'. Since prose is only a limited channel of expression, I put other forms of personal thoughts: photograph, poem, video clips or digital arts under 'arts'. 

The ideas in some posts might be very personal. 求同存异 would be greatly appreciated. 

The Best,
Kai
